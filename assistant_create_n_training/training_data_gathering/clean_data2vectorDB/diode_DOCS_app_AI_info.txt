#### Block Diagram of Tunneling Setup
The tunneling process involves four key components:
1. **The IoT Device**: Sends data to the IoT Server through a tunnel established by Entry/Exit Nodes.
2. **The Entry Node**: Establishes a secure tunnel with the Exit Node and routes IoT data. This can sometimes reside on the IoT device as software.
3. **The Exit Node**: Works similarly to the Entry Node but receives data from the tunnel. It may also be located on the IoT server.
4. **The IoT Server**: Hosts the IoT APIs and receives the data sent from the IoT device.

#### Example IoT Data Tunnel to Exosite's IoT Server
This section provides a practical example of setting up a tunneled data flow to Exosite’s IoT Server:

1. **IoT Device Setup**:
   - Use the Exosite device API documented at [Exosite Device HTTP API](https://docs.exosite.io/device-connectivity/device-http-api/).
   - Provision your IoT device identity by creating an IoT Connector.
   - Utilize the following curl command (adjust IP accordingly):
     ```bash
     curl -p 192.168.2.101:1080 -i 'https://a32ktas21gcas0000.m2.exosite.io/onep:v1/stack/alias' -H 'X-Exosite-CIK: 203cd79cfe95d0b4891ef43c73e531d3991fa502' -d 'data_in={"temperature1":42,"pressure1":135.02,"randomnum":122}' –v
     ```

2. **Entry Node Configuration**:
   - This should be a Linux device like a Raspberry Pi with the Diode CLI installed from [Diode CLI Download](https://diode.io/download#cli).
   - Find the Diode Client address using:
     ```bash
     diode time
     ```
   - Set up port forwarding using these commands:
     ```bash
     sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet=1
     sudo iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 1080 -j DNAT --to 127.0.0.1:1080
     ```
   - Bind the local port to the Exit Node:
     ```bash
     diode -bind=1080:0x139ad2e6fsc2377e0f03abc232ea9a83f2eaff371:1080
     ```

3. **Exit Node Configuration**:
   - Similar to the Entry Node, you need to have a Linux device with the Diode CLI installed.
   - Find the Exit Node's client address and create the tunnel with:
     ```bash
     diode publish -private 1080:1080,0xa2371412a83bfcb23e0ac9a5c82ed026a1b31ef -socksd
     ```

4. **IoT Server Setup**:
   - Create an account at [Exosite](https://exosite.io) and set up an IoT Connector.
   - Add a device with a unique identity and retrieve the IoT Connector's FQDN for later use.
