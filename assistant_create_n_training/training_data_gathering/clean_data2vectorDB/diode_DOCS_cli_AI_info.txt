The Diode CLI is positioned as a versatile tool for Web3 capabilities, allowing users to share local web development projects easily. Below are the key points and technical details from the page:

### Overview
- **Purpose**: The main purpose is to allow the sharing of local development websites on the Internet without the need for a dedicated server or domain name.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for getting feedback while developing a website or for hosting static content long-term.

### Technical Instructions

1. **Installation and Command**:
   - If a webserver is already running on `localhost` port 80, execute:
     ```bash
     diode publish -public 80:80
     ```
   - This command publishes the website accessible at `http://localhost:80` to the Diode Network, making it available at `https://<client_address>.diode.link`.

2. **Finding Client Address**:
   - The `<client_address>` will be displayed in the terminal when the command is executed. It provides a unique URL to share with others.

3. **Publishing on Different Ports**:
   - For a service running on a different port (e.g., port 2368), use:
     ```bash
     diode publish -public 2368:80
     ```
   - To publish multiple services, for example, port 80 and port 2368:
     ```bash
     diode publish -public 80:80,2368:8025
     ```

4. **Configuring a Domain Name**:
   - To customize the URL, set up a BNS (Blockchain Name System) name linked to your client address using:
     - MetaMask and Diode Network Explorer.
     - Or, using the command:
       ```bash
       diode bns -register my-example-name
       ```
   - Ensure to back up your wallet file located at `~/.config/diode/private.db` to avoid losing access to the registered domain.

5. **Secure Publishing Options**:
   - To restrict access to certain users, use:
     - For a single specified address:
       ```bash
       diode publish -private 80:80,<authorized_address>
       ```
     - For access control via a Fleet Contract:
       ```bash
       diode publish -protected 80:80
       ```
   - Users need to run the Diode Client on their local gateways for authentication.

### Important Notes

  ```bash
  diode publish -private 22:22,0x63115a27C3d1b549011198c69F4120CA4ea12EE9
  ```
- **Combined Access**: You can publish both public and private ports:
  ```bash
  diode publish -public 80:80 -private 22:22,0x63115a27C3d1b549011198c69F4120CA4ea12EE9
  ```
- **Protected Access**: This allows only systems from an authorized Fleet Contract to access the SSH interface.
  1. **Setting Up**: 
     - Enable MetaMask (link to installation not provided).
     - Create a Fleet Contract [here](https://diode.io/prenet/#/fleets).
     - Add the SSH Server’s Client Address to the Fleet Contract.
     - Configure the Diode Client:
     ```bash
     diode config -set fleet=<fleet address>
     ```
  2. **Publish as Protected**:
    ```bash
    diode publish -protected 22:22
    ```

### **SSH Client Usage**
1. **Connecting to the Server**:
   - Change to a different machine to connect via SSH.

The page provides information regarding the encryption of communications within the Diode Network. Here’s a detailed summary of the main information presented:

### Encryption Overview
- **End-to-End Encryption (E2E):**
  - The Diode Network supports various types of communication, both encrypted and non-encrypted.
  - The Diode Collab, Diode CLI, and other applications utilize 256-bit end-to-end encryption based on the elliptic curve secp256k1 domain parameter for secure server connections and E2E communications.

### Technical Information
- **Diode CLI:**
  - The Diode Command Line Interface (CLI) comes with E2E encryption enabled by default.
  - Users can control the E2E encryption setting through a command line parameter: `-e2e=<true/false>`. This allows the user to specify if the encryption should be active or not.

### Key Points on Usage
- The CLI application is designed for secure communications, ensuring that data transmitted through the Diode Network is protected.
- The system is developed to be user-friendly while still providing strong security features for sensitive operations.

### Additional Resources

The Diode Command Line Interface (CLI) is designed to facilitate interaction with the Diode Network, enabling users to harness its full capabilities. Below are the key details and technical information from the page:

#### Overview of Diode CLI
- **Purpose**: The Diode CLI allows users to easily access and manage various functionalities of the Diode Network. It serves as a gateway to tools that can publish Web3 content, connect with decentralized networks, and execute various commands.
- **Supported Systems**: The CLI can be installed on:
  - Linux
  - MacOS
  - Windows

#### Installation
- The CLI can be installed as a small program that runs from a terminal window or command line prompt.
- The documentation suggests checking the “Start Here” section for initial setup guidance and the “CLI Commands” section for detailed functionality.

#### Technical Features
- **BlockQuick(TM) Algorithm**: A proprietary algorithm used by the Diode CLI to enable direct interactions with compatible decentralized networks.
- **Use Cases**: Users can perform a variety of functions through the CLI, including but not limited to:
  - Publishing Web3 content
  - Hosting proxy servers
  - Remote access via SSH or VNC
  - Streaming RTMP video
  - Remote drive mapping
  
#### Helpful Links

The page from Diode Docs discusses the safety of using SSH (Secure Shell) over the public internet through the Diode platform. Here are the main points and important technical information extracted:

1. **General Safety Consideration**:
   - The document emphasizes that while it's generally safest not to expose any interface to the internet, SSH is designed to be a secure interface and can be safely exposed if proper precautions are taken.

2. **Recommendations for Securing SSH**:
   - The page references articles, such as those from RedHat, which provide tips for enhancing SSH security. While specific measures are not detailed on the page, readers are encouraged to consult external resources for comprehensive security guidelines.

3. **Publishing SSH with Diode**:
   - Diode CLI allows you to expose SSH functionality with the command:
     ```
     diode publish -public 22:22
     ```
   - In this command, `22:22` represents the local port 22 mapped to a public port 22. This setup allows for remote SSH access.

4. **Further Security Options**:
   - To enhance security, users can publish their SSH port in different modes:
     - **Private Mode**: Only a specific client can access the SSH service.
     - **Protected Mode**: Access is restricted to clients listed in your Fleet Contract.

In summary, while exposing SSH on the public internet can be done safely with Diode, adhering to best practices for security is crucial.### Docs on Other Products | Diode Docs
