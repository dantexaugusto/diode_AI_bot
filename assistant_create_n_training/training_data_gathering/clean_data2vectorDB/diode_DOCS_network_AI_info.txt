#### Overview of Fleet Contracts
- A **Fleet Contract** allows devices on the Diode Network to communicate securely. It acts as a sponsor for the device's communications.
- A single device can belong to multiple Fleet Contracts, but each communication session can only specify one Fleet Contract.

#### Key Functions
- Fleet Contracts serve as a **decentralized smart contract** that manages client identities (public keys).
- They facilitate various functions like:
  - Client registration and deregistration
  - Establishing protected or private connections
  - Managing the quality of service (QoS) based on the stake in the Fleet Contract

#### Stake and Quality of Service (QoS)
- Currently, there is no requirement for a stake in Fleet Contracts, but it is anticipated that in the future, having a stake will enhance the likelihood of quality performance by network infrastructure nodes.
- **No stake** may result in reduced interest from infrastructure nodes in handling the traffic associated with a device.

#### Usage for Commercial vs. Development
- For commercial applications, users are advised to create their own Fleet Contract. This prevents the risk of device communications being disabled by someone else's Fleet Contract.
- Diode offers a default **"Diode Developer Fleet Contract"** for non-commercial and testing purposes, located at: `0x6000000000000000000000000000000000000000`.

#### Commands and Configuration
- If the Fleet Contract is not explicitly set in the Diode Client, it defaults to the Developer Fleet Contract.
- To check which Fleet Contract your client is using, run the command:
  ```bash
  diode config
  ```
  This can also be checked via the **Diode Network Explorer** by searching for your client address, where it will display the associated Fleet Contract.

#### Creating Your Own Fleet Contract
- To create a Fleet Contract, you can use the **Diode Collab's Network feature** or the **Diode Network Explorer Fleets page** (requires MetaMask installation).
